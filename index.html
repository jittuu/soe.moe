          <p class="my-4">
            I’ve worked on all levels of the software stack, from defining the
            strategy to shaping projects to designing interfaces to writing code
            to marketing.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            I was working in Singapore, from 2006 to 2015, for companies from
            MNC companies like UTAC, HP to startups like Xuenn, Maloft. Always
            looking to understand the bigger picture, my role evolved from
            <span class="font-bold">Programmer </span>to
            <span class="font-bold">Architect </span> to
            <span class="font-bold">CTO</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            After I was back in Myanmar in 2015, I founded my first business, 
            <a href="https://www.kanoak.com">Kanoak</a>, with my wife. Kanoak is
            now a well-known online shop in Myanmar. We managed to release our
            own Kanoak app in 2021. During these years, I learned a lot about
            running a business, managing cash flow, sales, and marketing -
            especially Facebook marketing.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            In 2017, I founded my second business, Piti, with my two friends. We
            released our app, <a href="https://www.piti.app">Piti</a> - a
            loyalty program platform for businesses. I left Piti in 2020 with
            plenty of experience building and selling a SaaS product.
