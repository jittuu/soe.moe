        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I've worked on all levels of the software stack, from defining the
          strategy to shaping projects to designing interfaces to writing code
          to marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was working in Singapore, from 2006 to 2015, for companies from
          MNC companies like UTAC, HP to startups like Xuenn, Maloft. Always
          looking to understand the bigger picture, my role evolved from
          <strong>Programmer</strong> to
          <strong>Architect</strong> to
          <strong>CTO</strong>.

        <p>
          After I was back in Myanmar in 2015, I founded my first business,
          <a href="https://www.kanoak.com">Kanoak</a>, with my wife. Kanoak is
          now a well-known online shop in Myanmar. We launched our Kanoak app back in 2021.
          Since then, I've picked up a lot about running a businessâ€”things like handling cash flow, figuring out sales, and getting better at marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, I founded my second business, Piti, with my two friends. We
          released our app, <a href="https://www.piti.app">Piti</a> - a
          loyalty program platform for businesses. I left Piti in 2020 with
          plenty of experience building and selling a SaaS product.
